# Neural Network Regression Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of a neural network for regression tasks. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization. The goal is to predict a target variable from a large dataset using machine learning techniques.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

You can install the required packages using `pip` or `conda`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be in a `.csv` format. The dataset should have numeric features and a target variable that can be predicted. Replace `'data.csv'` in the code with the actual path to your dataset.

## File Structure

- `neural_network_regression_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the neural network for regression tasks, including data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Load and preprocess data**: 
    - Data is loaded from a CSV file and cleaned (missing values handled).
    - Features are selected, and categorical variables are encoded if necessary.
    - Data is split into training and testing sets, and the features are standardized.

2. **Build the neural network**:
    - A neural network model is created using Keras (part of TensorFlow) with one input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer for regression.

3. **Train the model**:
    - The model is trained using the training data, and the loss is monitored during training.

4. **Evaluate the model**:
    - The model is evaluated on the test data using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

5. **Visualize the results**:
    - Training/validation loss curves and actual vs. predicted values are plotted for better understanding and analysis of the model's performance.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/Neural-Network-Regression-Prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Neural-Network-Regression-Prediction
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook neural_network_regression_prediction.ipynb
    ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your own dataset and run the model.
